    A simple GUI Listener

    We use the socket listener from the MSN example with minor changes.
    We deal with preventing the listener from freezing the GUI by running it in its
    own thread.
    
    Pressing the go button starts the listener in another thread.
    
    To stop the listener, we kill its thread: not the best way to do this.
    
    In the real application, the thread will keep running along side the
    program, and the start/stop mechanism will effect simply skipping processes by
    setting a flag.
